Here we present the different codes used to produce and plot the different results for the different OD's. 
The title of the scripts corresponds to what section (or subsection) it represents. 
The optimized calculation of OD presented in Example 3 can be seen in the Random Distribution script as well as in the Language one.
The code was written in its entirety by the author alone. An AI tool (ChatGPT) was used to do two tasks a posteriori on the original code: 
  1) Rename and Reshape functions as to be more easily understood by the user; 
  2) Code Documentation, to provide better comments/explanations as to what does what.
